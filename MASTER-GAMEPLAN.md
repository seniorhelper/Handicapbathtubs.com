Last updated 2026-11-08 (overnight aging-network push). Network plan: Desktop\02 AGING SAFELY BATHS\07 Aging Safely Website Network\MASTER GAMEPLAN.md. Rules: C:\Users\zachw\aging-sweep\notes\RULES.md.

## Lane
Disability and wheelchair bathing (ADA, VA SAH/SHA, spinal cord injury, caregiver-assisted).

Every page here supports agingsafelybaths.com (quotes, installs) and never targets its head terms (walk in tubs, walk in tub cost, handicap showers, roll in showers, Medicaid/grants head terms). Max 2 followed network links per page; other network links nofollow; one nofollow Eye To Ad credit.

## Business facts
Aging Safely Baths & More, LLC. 1-888-779-2284, sales@agingsafelybaths.com. BBB A+ since 2012. Published prices only (RULES.md): walk-in tub about $15,500 installed after the $2,000 promo, $15,250 veterans, roll-in showers $13,500 to $17,000, wide/transfer/bariatric from about $19,000.

## Targets (one page owns one term)
- handicap bathtub
- wheelchair accessible bathtub
- ADA bathtub requirements
- bathtub for multiple sclerosis (new)

## Competitors (live check 2026-11-08; search results, not verified rank)
- ellasbubbles.com product pages: specific specs, sells only its own brand
- mobilityadvisor-style type lists: plain English, no ADA section numbers
- DME stores: price framing, no funding paths

**How we beat them:** Neutral decision table by disability type, sourced temperature and transfer guidance, funding paths.

## Done tonight (2026-11-08)
- Quote forms now post to the company lead server (clients.eyetoad.com/lead/send.php, saves to disk first, then emails sales) through /lead-send.js, with the old sender (FormSubmit or EmailJS) as automatic fallback. Pilot verified in a live browser on walkintubsflorida.com.
- GA4 tag (property per site, events generate_lead, phone_click, estimator_use) confirmed on every indexable page; Search Console verification file googleadb17462a109b3ca.html present.
- Lighthouse (home page, live, 2026-11-08 early morning) recorded before and after in _overnight-reports/aging-sites-report.md.
- robots.txt now names the AI crawlers.
- New /bathtubs-for-multiple-sclerosis/ (heat sensitivity, cool soaking, transfer options; VA MS and National MS Society sources).

## Next
1. ALS and amputee transfer pages (sourced)
1. State Medicaid waiver home-modification limits table (KFF waitlist data, state documents)
1. Update VA HISA amounts if S.1644 ($10,000) is enacted; verify on va.gov

## Morning to-dos (network)
- Add the six EmailJS satellites (seniorwalkintub, utahwalkintubs, walkintubdenver, walkintubscalifornia, walkintubschicago, walkintubstexas) to lead-config.php on clients.eyetoad.com so they stop falling back to EmailJS.
- Confirm where aging-site leads from the lead server are emailed (sales@agingsafelybaths.com?) and that the mail lands; fix eyetoad.com SPF/DMARC.
- Request indexing in Search Console for every new or changed URL listed in the report.
- AdSense: not added to these lead-gen pages on purpose (ads next to a quote form cost leads). Decide if any info-only page should carry it.

## Measurement
GA4 property per site (account 45765285), key events generate_lead and phone_click. Search Console: bare domain property, sitemap.xml submitted. Check queries and positions in GA4's Search Console report at the start of every project.
